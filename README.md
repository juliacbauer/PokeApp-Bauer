<h2>Prose Pal: Every reader's best friend.</h2>

Prose Pal is a word search app created with Next.js, deployed on Vercel, and that uses the Free Dictionary API (https://dictionaryapi.dev/).

Users can sign up and create an account to begin searching for words. From there, they can add words to their Vocabulary List to save them to reference later. They can also delete words from their Vocabulary Lists if they no longer need them saved.

Prose Pal is designed to be every reader - and writer's - best friend. Readers and writers are constantly coming across new words. This app allows them to truly build their vocabulary by learning about and saving these words, which helps commit them to memory and makes them more likely to use them in the future.
